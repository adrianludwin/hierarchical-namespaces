This directory is the default configuration of HNC, including internal cert
management ("cc" = "Cert Controller"). It's published as "default_cc.yaml" when
building the manifests ("made manifests" in the root directory) and aliased as
"default.yaml." In versions of HNC prior to v1.0, this was hnc_manager.yaml.
