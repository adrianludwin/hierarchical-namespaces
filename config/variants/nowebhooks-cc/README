This directory contains the controller-only version of HNC; that is, it doesn't
install or configure any webhooks. It does, however, run cert-controller (hence
the "cc" suffix) to inject certs on any HNC webhooks that _are_ installed -
e.g., by using the ha-webhooks-cc variant.

"make manifests" builds this directory into manifests/nowebhooks-cc.yaml, which
is further processed into ha.yaml along with ha-webhooks-cc.
